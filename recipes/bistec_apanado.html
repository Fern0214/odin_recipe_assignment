            <li>1/2 cup of vegetable oil</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

                The first thing to do is cut the steaks into thin slices. Then season them with
                a little salt and pepper.

                On the other hand, it disintegrates the cookies or bread very well so that it can 
                adhere well to the meat and the crust acna be crispy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Next, proceed to flour the steaks on both sides until they are covered very well. 
                Then flatten them with the help of a kneader or a fuller's stone until the desired 
                thinness is obtained.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pass them throught the egg and, finally, through the cookies or breadcrumbs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a fryping pan with a drizzle of oil. When the oil is very hot, proceed to fry 
                the steaks, turning constantly to obtain an even browning.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the steaks and place them on a paper towel to remove excess fat.
            </li>

                Serve each stak on a plate and accompany with a portion of green boodles and potatoes 
                a la huancaina. Another excellent option can be a serving of grained rice and parboiled 
                potatoes.
