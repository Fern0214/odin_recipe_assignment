        <ul>
            <li>4 beef steaks</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of wheat flour</li>
            <li>2 beaten eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup of crackers or breadcrumps</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>
                The first thing to do is cut the steaks into thin slices. Then season them with
                a little salt and pepper.
            </li>

            <li>
                On the other hand, it disintegrates the cookies or bread very well so that it <canvas>
                adhere well to the meat and the crust can be crispy.
            </li>

            <li>
                Next, proceed to flour the steaks on both sides until they are covered very well.
                Then flatten them with the help of a kneader or a fuller's stone until the desired
                thinness is obtained.
            </li>

            <li>
                Pass them throught the egg and, finally, through the cookies or breadcrumbs.
            </li>

            <li>
                Heat a frying pan with a drizzle of oil. When the oil is very hot, proceed to fry
                the steaks, turning constantly to obtain an even browning.
            </li>

            <li>
                Remove the steaks and place them on a paper towel to remove excess fat.
            </li>

            <li>
                Serve each steak on a plate and accompany with a portion of green boodles and potatoes
                a la huancaina. Another excellent option can be a serving of grained rice and parboiled
                potatoes.
